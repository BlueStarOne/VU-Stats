# VU-Stats
Python programs to calculate your total progression in Vector Unit's games


## About the project
Of all the games made by Vector Unit, very few let you know what's your total progress is in the game. That's why I decided to create python programs that allow you to know your total progress in the games as well as other things.

## Features

### Beach Buggy Racing 2 Stats :

- Calculate your total progression
- Calculate your races win/loss ratio (WLR)
- Calculate your tournaments win/loss ratio (WLR)
- Calculate your average speed
- Calculate the average time you will need to level up to the next level

⚠️ Due to some stats missing in the game, the accuracy can't reach 100%. Anyway, the accuracy is at the highest level that can actually be reached

## How to use

Step 1: Download the python code for the game you want to calculate your progress

Step 2: Download any python app on your device (I recommend using [ACode](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foxdebug.acode). In this case you will need to install the python 2.0 plugin)

Step 3: Open the code in the app and run it

Step 4: Follow the steps of the program

⚠️ For most of the questions, you will have to look the stats section in your game to find the answer. BUT for some questions you will have to make an estimate. These questions will be highlighted.
