# VU-Stats
Python programs to calculate you total progression in Vector Unit's games


## About the project
Of all the games made by Vector Unit, very few let you know what your total progress is in the game. That's why I decided to create python programs that allow you to know your total progress in the games as well as other things. 

## Available to download :
- Beach Buggy Racing 2 Stats

## Features

### Beach Buggy Racing 2 Stats :

- Calculate your total progression
- Calculate your races win/loss ratio (WLR)
- Calculate your tournaments win/loss ratio (WLR)
- Calculate your average speed
- Calculate the average time you will need to level up to the next level

## How to use

Step 1: Download the python code for the game you want to calculate your progress
Step 2: Download any python app on your device (I recommend using [ACode](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foxdebug.acode) 
Step 3: Open the code in the app and run it
Setp 4: Follow the steps

⚠️ For most of the questions, you will have to look the stats section in your game to find the answer. BUT for some questions you will have to make an estimate. These questions will be highlighted.
